# Buyer Funnel Analysis – Price Impact and Conversion Optimization

### 📌 Project Overview
This SQL-based project focused on analyzing the **buyer funnel** across key e-commerce categories to uncover the root causes of **sales decline** despite steady traffic and add-to-cart volumes.  
The objective was to identify where conversion was dropping and propose actionable interventions to recover sales performance.

### 🧩 Problem Statement
A noticeable **sales decrease** was observed in high-demand categories, even though customer engagement metrics such as page views and add-to-carts remained healthy.  
The goal was to analyze the full buyer funnel — from **traffic to purchase** — to locate where and why the funnel was breaking.

### ⚙️ Approach
I built a comprehensive SQL pipeline that merged **transactional** and **behavioral** datasets (orders, items, buyers, and user activity) at the seller and category level.  
This enabled granular tracking of the following KPIs:
- **Traffic (UVs & PVs)**  
- **Add-to-Carts (A2C)**  
- **Orders, Buyers, and GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)**  
- **Platform and Seller Discounts**  
- **Assortment Performance**

The SQL script integrated multiple tables, harmonized data to the same granularity, and produced a unified dataset for analysis and Power BI automation.

### 🧠 Key Insights
- **Conversion Drop Identified:** The funnel showed strong traffic and add-to-cart numbers but a sharp **drop from cart to purchase**.  
- **Root Cause:** A **price increase** in certain stationery & craft subcategories led to customer drop-off before checkout.  
- **Action Taken:** Communicated findings to category and seller teams, recommending **price adjustments** and **discount optimization**.

### 🚀 Outcome
- **Improved Conversion Rate** after pricing alignment  
- **Increased Sales Volume** in key high-demand categories  
- **Enhanced visibility** into buyer behavior through a structured funnel dataset  
- **Automated SQL view** feeding Power BI dashboard for ongoing monitoring

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction, aggregation, and funnel computation  
- **Power BI** – Visualization and continuous funnel tracking  
- **Excel** – Ad-hoc validation and summarization  

### 📈 Impact
This project enabled:
- **Faster diagnosis** of sales decline causes  
- **Data-backed decisions** on pricing and discounting strategies  
- **Sustainable sales uplift** through funnel optimization
